# Project Summary

In this project I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator, selected randomly
based on latitude and longitude and Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
 
To accomplish this, I've utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API and Jupyter Notebook, 
and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

my objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
